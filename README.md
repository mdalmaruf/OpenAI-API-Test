# OpenAI API with Python ChatCompletion using Jupyter Notebook

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through setting up your Python environment to interact with the OpenAI API, specifically using the ChatCompletion feature. We will be using Jupyter Notebook for running and testing our code. Before we begin, ensure you have Python 3.9 and Anaconda installed.

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements

1. **Python 3.9**: Ensure you have Python 3.9 installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Anaconda**: Anaconda helps manage Python packages and environments. Download it from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

You can use any of the following IDEs:

- VS Code
- Visual Studio
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Conda Environment

Open your terminal (or VS Code terminal) and run the following commands to set up a conda environment:

```sh
# Create a conda environment named 'venv' with Python 3.9
conda create -p venv python=3.9

# Check the list of conda environments
conda env list

# Activate the newly created environment
conda activate venv
